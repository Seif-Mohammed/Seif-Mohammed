## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Seif Mohammed, a passionate Software Developer with a strong focus on **Odoo ERP development** and **Python applications**. I leverage my skills to build robust and efficient solutions, particularly enjoying the challenges of customizing ERP systems to meet specific business needs.

While my core expertise lies in Odoo and Python, I also have a solid background in embedded systems, microcontroller driver development (AVR, ARM Cortex), robotics, and applying image processing techniques (MATLAB) to solve real-world problems.

I thrive on bridging the gap between complex business requirements and functional software, whether it's developing custom Odoo modules, creating Python-based tools, or programming low-level hardware.

## ðŸš€ Skills & Technologies

### Odoo & Python Expertise

*   **Odoo:** Proficient in Odoo (v18 experience), specializing in custom module development, ORM, Views (XML), Controllers, Workflows, Access Rights, and Reporting. Experienced in developing modules for manufacturing (Technical Office, Inventory, BOM Management) and integrating complex business logic.
*   **Python:** Extensive experience using Python for Odoo backend development, building standalone applications (including GUIs with PyQt6), scripting, and automation.

## âœ¨ Featured Project: Odoo ERP Module for Electrical Panel Manufacturing

*   **Description:** Developed a comprehensive custom module for **Odoo 18** tailored to the specific needs of an electrical panel builder factory.
*   **Core Functionality:** Integrated **Technical Office** operations (project tracking, panel/cell configuration, specifications) with **Inventory Management** (stock control, authorization workflows, BOM generation).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Detailed Project & Panel Management (`technical.office.project`, `technical.office.project.panel`)
    *   Dynamic Bill of Materials (BOM) generation and management at both panel and project levels (`technical.office.project.bom`, `inventory.boms`).
    *   Automated stock updates and inventory authorization workflows (`inventory.auth`, `inventory.product`).
    *   Custom data models, business logic, and constraints using Odoo ORM and Python.
*   **Impact:** Streamlined factory processes, improved data accuracy, and provided better control over project execution and inventory.
*   **Technologies:** Odoo 18, Python, PostgreSQL, XML (Views).

## ðŸ”§ Other Projects

*   **CubeSat Ground Station GUI:** User-friendly interface for CubeSat communication and control (Python, PyQt6).
*   **Busbar Bending Calculator:** Professional engineering application for electrical busbar design calculations (Python, PyQt6).
*   **Autonomous/Remote Control Robotic Car:** Bluetooth-controlled and line-following robot (C, Embedded C).
*   **AVR Microcontroller Drivers:** Collection of tested, low-level hardware abstraction drivers (C, AVR Assembly).
*   **Fake Currency Authentication System:** Image processing system for coin detection and counting (MATLAB).
*   **Vehicle Detection System:** Computer vision system for vehicle detection in noisy conditions (MATLAB).
